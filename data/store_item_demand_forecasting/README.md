# Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge

The objective of this competition is to predict 3 months of item-level sales data at different store locations.

You are given 5 years of store-item sales data, and asked to predict 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores.

Submissions are evaluated on SMAPE between forecasts and actual values. We define SMAPE = 0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0.
